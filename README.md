# Full-Stack-Flight-Search-System
This project is developed using Java Spring Boot for backend, PL/SQL for database management, and Docker for containerization. The aim is to build a scalable and robust application. In future iterations, I plan to integrate React for the frontend, providing a full-stack solution with a modern and responsive UI.
